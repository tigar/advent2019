|Problem| Solution| Notes/Thoughts|
|--|--|--|
[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1)| [Day1Part1.py](https://github.com/tigar/advent2019/blob/master/day1part1.py)  |  |
| |[Day2Part2.py](https://github.com/tigar/advent2019/blob/master/day1part1.py)| The for loop on line 12 could likely be written cleaner, likely without a temporary variable|
[Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2)| [Day2.py](https://github.com/tigar/advent2019/blob/master/day2.py)  | |
[Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3)| [Day3.py](https://github.com/tigar/advent2019/blob/master/day3.py)  | |
[Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4)| [Day4.py](https://github.com/tigar/advent2019/blob/master/day4.py)  | I definitely should've combined everything into one function, but I'm posting the code as written! Trying to think how I should post refactors...|
[Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5)| [Day5.py](https://github.com/tigar/advent2019/blob/master/day5.py)  | Absolutely the hardest one for me so far. Just understanding each of the instructions (espcially input) took me too many hours. Day 2 wasn't too tricky, I think it was a reading comprehension issue mostly.|
